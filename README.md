# Sign Language Detection

This repository contains code for detecting and recognizing sign language gestures using computer vision techniques.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by downloading or cloning this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git
    ```

2. **Install Requirements**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    cd sign-language-detection
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create Folders for Sign Language Examples**: Create a folder structure to store examples of sign language gestures. For example, if you want to capture the gesture for the letter 'A', create a folder named 'A'.

    ```bash
    mkdir A
    ```

    Similarly, create folders for other letters or gestures as needed.

4. **Capture Hand Images**: Run the data collection (`data collection.py` or any other relevant script) to capture hand images. Press the 's' key to capture images of the hand gestures. Images will be saved in the respective folders you created earlier.

5. **Training the Model**: Once you have captured enough hand gesture images, you need to train a machine learning model. You can use Google's Teachable Machine or any other suitable tool for this purpose. Train the model using the captured images and download the trained model as a Keras model file.

6. **Integration with Test Script**: After downloading the trained model file, add it to your project directory. Then, update the `test.py` script (or any other relevant script) to load and use the trained model for inference.

7. **Run Test Script**: Finally, run the test script to perform inference using the trained model. The output of the test script will show the detected sign language gestures.

## Additional Notes
